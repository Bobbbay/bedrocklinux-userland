Usage: brl [-c CONDITIONAL] COMMAND

If '-c' is not provided, brl will run COMMAND in all enabled clients.

if '-c' is the first argument followed by a CONDITIONAL, the CONDITIONAL will
be run in all enabled clients and if that command returns 0 the following
COMMAND will be run.

Examples:

    # attempt to ping google in all clients to check if networking is working
    brl ping -c 1 google.com

    # run 'apt-get update' in all clients that have apt-get locally
    brl -c 'brw apt-get|grep local' apt-get update

    # clear the statoverride file in all clients which have it
    brl -c '[ -e /var/lib/dpkg/statoverride ]' echo '' > /var/lib/dpkg/statoverride

EOF
	exit 0
fi

if [ "$1" = "-c" ]
then
	conditional="$2"
	shift
	shift
else
	conditional="true"
fi

for CLIENT in $(bri -l)

	if eval "brc $CLIENT $conditional"

		echo "brl: running commands in $CLIENT"
		brc $CLIENT "$@"

		echo "brl: skipping $CLIENT (conditional not met)"
