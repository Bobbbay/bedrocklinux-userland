Usage: brl [-c CONDITIONAL] COMMAND

If '-c' is not provided, brl will run COMMAND with all available client local
contexts.

If '-c' is the first argument followed by a CONDITIONAL, the CONDITIONAL will
be run in all enabled clients local contexts and if that command returns 0 the
following COMMAND will be run.

Examples:

    # attempt to ping google ito check if networking is working
    brl ping -c 1 google.com

    # run 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade' in all clients that have
    # apt-get available in the local context
    brl -c 'brw apt-get|grep "(direct)$"' sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'

    # List all of the pids and their corresponding clients.  Can append "| sort
    # -n" to sort by pid.
    brl bri -P | grep -v "brl\|bri"
