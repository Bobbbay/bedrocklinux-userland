# this is a meta-shell which solves to potential issues:
# - the full path to the desired shell changes from client to client, but
# /etc/passwd requires the full path to the desired shell.  Hence, one can call
# brsh - which should stay in the same place in all the clients -  and it can
# call the desired shell.
# - if the client which contains the desired shell breaks, fixing the issue can
# be a bit of a mess.  This shell can attempt to detect this situation and drop
# back to another, hopefully functioning, shell.

# TODO: find a better way to determine if login shell or not
# TODO: find a shell-agnostic way to launch as login shell instead of sourcing /etc/profile directly
# - perhaps force user to add the info to ~/.brsh.conf?

# hacky way to determine if called as login shell
# TZ known to be set in /etc/profile - if it has not been set yet, probably login
