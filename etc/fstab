### Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha3 Bosco
### /etc/fstab
#
# For the most part, this is a /etc/fstab file such as you would find in any
# other Linux distribution, and documentation for those distributions should
# apply here as well.  This file is primarily used for mounting partitions at
# boot or setting up the functionality for devices to be easily mounted by an
# end-user, such as optical drives.
#
# However, there are a few additional things to note:
#
# - Bedrock Linux ensures /proc, /sys, /dev, /dev/pts, /dev/shm, and the root
# directory are all set up during the init process and do not necessarily need
# to be placed here.
#
# - If you place all of the clients in the same directory (such as
# /var/chroot), it may be useful to bind mount the root directory to that
# location to have the core Bedrock Linux act like every toher client. You can
# uncomment the following line to do this:
#/  /var/chroot/bedrock  bind  defaults,bind  0  0
#
# - After the mounts from this are created, /bedrock/etc/brclients.conf is
# parsed and mount points are created from the "share" items there.  If you
# would like to mount anything *after* that takes place, you will have to use
# something other than /etc/fstab, such as /etc/rc.local
#
# - There are limitations of the system put in place to share files and
# directories as set in /bedrock/etc/brclients.conf; for example, every item
# shared has to be in the same place in all of the clients which share it.
# While symlinks can partially alleviate this particular issue, if you'd prefer
# to have more fined-tuned control of how sharing works, feel free to disregard
# the share settings in /bedrock/etc/brclients.conf and simply create bind
# mounts in /etc/fstab that are to your liking.
