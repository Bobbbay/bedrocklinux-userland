### Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha4 Flopsie
### /etc/fstab
#
# For the most part, this is a /etc/fstab file such as you would find in any
# other Linux distribution, and documentation for those distributions should
# apply here as well.  This file is primarily used for mounting partitions at
# boot or setting up the functionality for devices to be easily mounted by an
# end-user, such as optical drives.
#
# However, there are a few additional things to note:
#
# - Bedrock Linux ensures /proc, /sys, /dev, /dev/pts, /dev/shm, and the root
# directory are all set up during the init process and do not necessarily need
# to be placed here.
#
# - The Bedrock Linux core system itself should be made accessible as a client.
# Thus, it is bind-mounted into the location where the clients should go below.

/  /bedrock/clients/bedrock  bind  defaults,bind  0  0

# - If you have other clients on different partitions, they should be mounted
# into /bedrock/clients and should have bind items in their
# client.conf/framework after the /bedrock item, similar to how the core is
# mounted into /bedrock/clients/bedrock in the recommended defaults.
#
# - After the mounts from this are created, the bind and union items from the
# client.conf and frameworks are mounted.  If you would like to mount anything
# *after* that takes place, you will have to use something other than
# /etc/fstab, such as /etc/rc.local
