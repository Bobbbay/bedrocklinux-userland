# Place commands for clients to run at shutdown in the order that you would
# like to boot them.  For example, if you would like Debian squeeze's cups
# daemon to stop at shutdown:
# brc squeeze /etc/init.d/cups stop
#
# Note that this is being run as a full bourne shell script; if you would like
# to try to be fancy and attempt to parallelize things it should be quite possible.
