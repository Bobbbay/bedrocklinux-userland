Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha4 Flopsie userland
========================================

This is the bulk of the userland for Bedrock Linux.  Further information can be
found at [http://bedrocklinux.org](http://bedrocklinux.org).

Specifically, this is the README and files for the fourth alpha, Flopsie.  More
information about this release of Bedrock Linux can be found here:
[http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha4/](http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha4/).

You should probably read everything there before continuing to do anything with
these files, if you have not already.  The instructions in this README are not
sufficient on their own.
