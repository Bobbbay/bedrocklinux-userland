# This fstab is just like an fstab you would use for any other distro, except
# it is run before the init system is ever run.  It is primarily used to ensure
# init systems on partitions other than the root partition are accessible.
# Note it is managed by busybox; any fstab setting busybox does not understand
# will not be utilized.
