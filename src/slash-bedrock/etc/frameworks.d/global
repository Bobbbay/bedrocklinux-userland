# Most strata should use the default framework.  The notable exception is the
# global stratum which should instead use this one.  Most of the default
# framework's settings inform Bedrock Linux which files to acquire from the
# global stratum instead of the local stratum.  For the global stratum this
# does not make sense and can cause issues.  However, some settings - such as
# preenable - make sense for all strata.

# Bedrock Linux has hooks to run executables before/after enabling/disabling a
# stratum.  These are required to ensure various things are in place which
# Bedrock Linux expects for some of the above share items to work.
preenable = /bedrock/share/brs/force-symlinks
preenable = /bedrock/share/brs/setup-etc
preenable = /bedrock/share/brs/run-lock

# No default scripts for the following hooks, but feel free to make your own.
# postenable
# predisable
# postdisable

# "enable" indicates if the given stratum should be enabled at boot time.  This
# can either be "boot" (indicating it should be enabled at boot time) or
# "manual" (indicating it will be enabled/disabled manually).
#
# Feel free to override this with a "enable = manual" in the corresponding
# stratum's section in /bedrock/etc/strata.conf or
# /bedrock/etc/strata.d/<stratum>.conf.
enable = boot

# "init" indicates the given stratum can provide an init system.  The value
# should be the command to run at boot if this stratum is chosen to provide
# init.  The value is the entire line after the "="; do not place multiple init
# commands in the same line separated by ","'s as one can do with "share".
# Historically, "/sbin/init" is utilized as the command to run the init;
# however, systemd systems seem to prefer /lib/systemd/system without a
# corresponding symlink at "/sbin/init".
#
# In the corresponding stratum's section in /bedrock/etc/strata.conf or
# /bedrock/etc/strata.d/<stratum>.conf, add something to the effect of
#
#     init = /sbin/init
#
# or
#
#     init = /lib/systemd/systemd
#
# To have it considered when querying the user for the init to chose.
