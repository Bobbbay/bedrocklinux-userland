bru ("Bedrock Union filesystem")
================================

The bru command will mount a filesystem, unioning the contents of two
directories. All filesystem calls to the mount point will be redirected to one
of the directories, except a specified list which will be redirected to the
other directory. This is setup for you automatically by the brs command
depending on the union in the stratum.conf file for any given stratum.


Usage
-----

Typically this setup automatically by the brs command and will not be directly
utilized by any individual.  If you would like to use it directly for whatever
reason:

- The first argument is the mount point
- The second argument is the directory to which filesystem calls will be
  redirected by default
- The third argument is the directory specifically listed items will be
  redirected into
- The remaining arguments are the files which should be redirected into the
  directory specified in the third argument rather than the second. These
  should be relative to the mount point and not start with a slash.

For example, if bru is called with

    bru /tmp /mnt/realtmp /dev/shm /.X11-unix /.X0-lock

all calls to /tmp or its contents will be redirected to /mnt/realtmp except for
.X11-unix and .X0-lock, which will be redirected to /dev/shm/.X11-unix and
/dev/shm/.X0-lock.

Installation
------------

Bedrock Linux should be distributed with a script which handles installation,
but just in case:

The dependencies are:

- fuse

To compile, run

    make

To install into installdir, run

    make prefix=<installdir> install

Then proceed to use "setcap" to set the "cap_sys_chroot=ep" capability on the
installed brc executable.

To clean up, like usual:

    make uninstall

And finally, to remove it, run:

    make prefix=<installdir> uninstall
