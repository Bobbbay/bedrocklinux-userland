libbedrock
==========

This is simply C code used by multiple Bedrock Linux utilities to avoid code
redundancy.  Nothing particularly special to see here.

To compile, run

    make

to install into installdir, run

    make prefix=<installdir> install

To clean up, like usual:

    make uninstall

And finally, to remove it, run:

    make prefix=<installdir> uninstall
